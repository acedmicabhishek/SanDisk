The Problem with this research is that it is not right , A SLC region cant replace the Dram performace.
Because the FTL will be needed to do the wear Leveling and this means the FTL will be needed to do update the table super frequent and , in case of AI it will be needed to load alot of GBs lookup table for LBA and PBAs and searching on those sloopy SLC wont be as fast as Dram
